            "Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \\n\\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\\n\\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \\n\\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \\\"Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\\\" Pretty much always my thought process. \\n\\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \\n\\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!\n",

            "[CLS] Kabuto is your run - of - the - mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \\ n \\ nThis place is great for lunch. $ 9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh... If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, ( you do too. admit it ) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce ( DUDE ) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit / entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping.... \\ n \\ nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $ 10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $ 10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \\ n \\ nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal - delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to - go beverage. \\ \" Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful! \\ \" Pretty much always my thought process. \\ n \\ nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \\ n \\ nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch / service, Kabuto!
