# ml

The collection of short projects and excercises around machine learning which I made independently of the projects for university classes.

- NNs_makemore – code written while watching a tutorial ![Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&si=K4BrGo2RbAkrkxPO) by Andrej Karpathy. Includes implementation of a simple neural network from scratch and more and more advanced implementations of network generating names, from bigram model through multilayer perceptron and LSTM to attention. I've made it in 2024.

- natural_language_processing – various topics about natural language processing. Includes work from laboratories on Poznan University Of Technology on subject "Natural Learning processing", notebooks from more advanced class which I didn't attend but watch them and make excercises, and my implementation of Word2Vec model. 

- rnn_classifying names – RNN nework classifying names to the language on char level. Notebook based on Pytorch tutorial, which I followed in 2024

- Architekci_DL (DL architects) – made while attending GHOST students group, section Deep learning in 2022

- book – while reading "Uczenie maszynowe z użyciem Scikit-learn i Tensorflow" by A. Geron in 2021

- ml_cars – data analysis made during Data Camp Masterclass in 2021

- ml_filmy – data analysis based on films from imdb
